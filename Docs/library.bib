abstract = {Do van der Waals interactions determine the smallest nanostructures that can be used for atom optics? This question is studied with regard to the problem of designing an atom interferometer with optimum sensitivity to de Broglie wave phase shifts. The optimum sensitivity to acceleration and rotation rates is also considered. For these applications we predict that nanostructures with a period smaller than 40 nm will cause atom interferometers to perform poorly because van der Waals interactions adversely affect how nanostructure gratings work as beam-splitters.},

This work is motivated by recent experiments involving simultaneous optical trapping of two different alkali species. Our data can be used to predict the oscillation frequencies of optically-trapped atoms, and particularly the ratios of frequencies of different species held in the same trap.

abstract = {The problem of the anomalous ratios of the oscillator strengths in the heavy alkali principal series, though known for almost 70 years, still attracts the attention of both theorists and experimentalists. Our present fully relativistic model potential calculations demonstrate that the spin-orbit interaction cannot be solely responsible for the observed anomalies in potassium, rubidium and caesium and that they result from the interplay of spin-orbit interaction, core-valence electron correlation (core polarization) and cancellation observed in transition integrals. The role of core polarization is carefully studied. It is shown that in the case of the empirically adjusted model potential the most important correction is not the inclusion of polarization potential but the allowance made for the additional induced dipole moment in the dipole moment operator of transition. Also the form employed to represent the correction to the dipole moment is important, if one wishes to avoid any adjustment in core polarization corrections. It is also shown that the employment of J -dependent effective model potentials ( J = total angular momentum) is essential in reproducing relativistic effects in f -value ratios.},

abstract = {High-precision measurements of atomic parity-nonconserving transitions in cesium when coupled with calculations of similar accuracy allow for a precise determination of Q/sub W/, the weak nuclear charge. When expressed in terms of the Z mass, radiative corrections to Q/sub W/ are insensitive to the top-quark mass, so such a determination of Q/sub W/ allows a particularly sensitive probe of radiative corrections depending on new physics. While the wave function of cesium, the atom in which the most accurate measurements have been made, is extremely complex, atomic theory has advanced to a point where predictions accurate to 1% can be made. This paper describes such a calculation with particular emphasis on the question of the reliability of the atomic theory. Particle-physics implications following from the present state of theory and experiment are discussed, and prospects for more accurate work described},

abstract = {This paper reports on a comprehensive study of the long-range interaction of the 39 K (4s)+ 39 K (4p) asymptotic system. We present a detailed discussion of the R -dependent angular momentum couplings and correlation between the Hund’s case (a) and case (c) molecular states. Analytical expressions for the 16 adiabatic Hund’s case (c) long-range potential curves are derived including the higher order dispersion forces and the effects of retardation. Experimentally, six Hund’s case (c) long-range molecular states ( 0 u + , 1 g , and 0 g − dissociating to the 4 2 S 1/2 +4 2 P 3/2 asymptote and 0 u + , 1 g , and 0 g − to the 4 2 S 1/2 +4 2 P 1/2 limit) are observed with rovibrational resolution by photoassociative spectroscopy of ultracold 39 K atoms in a high density magneto-optical trap(MOT). Among the six observed long-range states, the upper 0 g − “pure long-range” state has negligible short-range chemical exchange contributions and the measured molecular binding energies (v=0–26) are used to precisely determine the long-range potential constants of the 4s+4p interaction. We determine: C 3 $\Pi$ =8.436(14) a.u. , C 3 $\Sigma$ =16.872(28) a.u. , C 6 $\Pi$ =6272(94) a.u. , and C 6 $\Sigma$ =9365(141) a.u. . Molecular constants for the three special pure long-range states, the 0 g − and 1 u (dissociating to the 4 2 P 3/2 limit and with potential minimum) and the 1 u (dissociating to the 4 2 P 1/2 and with potential maximum), are reported. The internal consistency of the theoretical model used in this work is confirmed by the excellent agreement between the long-range potential curve of the 1 g state obtained in present work (from the 0 g − state) and the long-range portion of the RKR potential curve of the 1 1 $\Pi$ g state previously determined by conventional molecular spectroscopy. The radiative lifetime of the K 4p state derived from the dipole–dipole interaction constant C 3 $\Pi$ is also in excellent agreement with a recent fast-beam measurement.},

abstract = {We reanalyzed our atom interferometer measurement of the electric polarizability of lithium now accounting for the Sagnac effect due to Earth rotation. The resulting correction to the polarizability is very small but the visibility as a function of the applied phase shift is now better explained. The fact that the Sagnac and polarizability phase shifts are both proportional to $v^{-1}$, where $v$ is the atom velocity, suggests that a phase shift of the Sagnac type could be used as a counterphase to compensate the electric polarizability phase shift. This exact compensation opens the way to higher accuracy measurements of atomic polarizabilities and we discuss how this can be practically done and the final limitations of the proposed technique.},

abstract = {Here we present the first two-dimensional images of the virtual source of a supersonic helium expansion. The images were obtained using a free-standing Fresnel zone plate with an outermost zone width of 50 nm as imaging lens and a beam cooled to around 125 K. The nozzle diameter was 10 $\mu$m. The virtual source diameter was found to increase with stagnation pressure from 140 ± 30 $\mu$m at po = 21 bar up to 270 ± 25 $\mu$m at po = 101 bar. The experimental results are compared to a theoretical model based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation by the method of moments. The quantum mechanical cross sections used in the model have been calculated for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and the Hurly-Moldover (HM) potentials. By using a scaling of the perpendicular temperature that parametrizes the perpendicular velocity distribution based on a continuum expansion approach, the LJ potential shows a good overall agreement with the experiment. However, at higher pressures the data points lie in between the two theoretical curves and the slope of the trend is more similar to the HM curve. Real gas corrections to enthalpy are considered but they affect the results less than the experimental errors.},

abstract = {We report an experimental measurement of a light wavelength at which the ac electric polarizability equals zero for 87Rb atoms in the F=2 ground hyperfine state. The experiment uses a condensate interferometer both to find this 'tune-out' wavelength and to accurately determine the light polarization for it. The wavelength lies between the D1 and D2 spectral lines at 790.03235(3) nm. The measurement is sensitive to the tensor contribution to the polarizability, which has been removed so that the reported value is the zero of the scalar polarizability. The precision is fifty times better than previous tune-out wavelength measurements. Our result can be used to determine the ratio of matrix elements |<5P3/2||d||5S1/2>/<5P1/2||d||5S1/2>|^2 = 1.99219(3), a 100-fold improvement over previous experimental values.

abstract = {Optical experiments have demonstrated cases in which mirror symmetry in stable atoms is broken during the absorption or emission of light. Such results, which are in conflict with quantum electrodynamics, support the theory of unification of the electromagnetic and weak interactions. The interpretation of the experimental results is based on exchanges of weak neutral Z/sub 0/ bosons between the electrons and the nucleus of the atom. A concise review of these phenomena in atomic physics is presented. The role of precise caesium parity-violation experiments, as a source of valuable information about electroweak physics, is illustrated by examples pertaining to experimental conditions which, in some cases, are not accessible to accelerator experiments. We give the basic principles of experiments, some under way and others completed, where a quantitative determination of the nuclear weak charge, Q/sub w/, which plays for the Z/sup 0/ exchange the same role as the electric charge for the Coulomb interaction is to be, or has been achieved. In the most recent and most precise experiment the accuracy on Q/sub w/ is limited to 1% by the uncertainty due to atomic physics calculations. Such a result challenges specialists in atomic theory and nuclear structure, since a more accurate determination of Q/sub w/ would mean more stringent constraints upon possible extensions of the standard model. Moreover, clear evidence has recently been obtained for the existence of the nuclear anapole moment, which describes the valence electron interaction with a chiral nuclear-magnetization component induced by the parity-violating nuclear forces. In writing this review, our hope was to make clear that any improvement in atomic parity-violation measurements will allow the exploration of new areas of electroweak physics},

abstract = {We apply the sum-over-states approach to calculate partial contributions to parity nonconservation (PNC) in cesium [Porsev, Beloy, and Drevianko, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 181601 (2009)]. We find significant corrections to two nondominating terms coming from the contribution of the core and highly excited states (n>9, the so called tail). When these differences are taken into account the result of Porsev et al., EPNC=0.8906(24)×10-11i(-QW/N) changes to 0.8977 (40), coming into good agreement with our previous calculations, 0.8980 (45). The interpretation of the PNC measurements in cesium still indicates reasonable agreement with the standard model (1.5$\sigma$); however, it gives new constraints on physics beyond it.},

Our approach uses high-precision, relativistic all-order methods in which all single, double, and partial triple excitations of the Dirac-Fock wave functions are included to all orders of perturbation theory. We discuss the use of magic-zero wavelengths for sympathetic cooling in two-species mixtures of alkalis with group-II and other elements of interest.

abstract = {Using an atom interferometer, we have measured the static electric polarizability of $^7$Li $\alpha =(24.33 \pm 0.16)\times10^{-30} $ m$^3$ $= 164.19\pm 1.08 $ atomic units with a 0.66% uncertainty. Our experiment, which is similar to an experiment done on sodium in 1995 by D. Pritchard and co-workers, consists in applying an electric field on one of the two interfering beams and measuring the resulting phase-shift. With respect to D. Pritchard's experiment, we have made several improvements which are described in detail in this paper: the capacitor design is such that the electric field can be calculated analytically; the phase sensitivity of our interferometer is substantially better, near 16 mrad/$\sqrt{Hz}$; finally our interferometer is species selective it so that impurities present in our atomic beam (other alkali atoms or lithium dimers) do not perturb our measurement. The extreme sensitivity of atom interferometry is well illustrated by our experiment: our measurement amounts to measuring a slight increase $\Delta v$ of the atom velocity $v$ when it enters the electric field region and our present sensitivity is sufficient to detect a variation $\Delta v/v \approx 6 \times 10^{-13}$.},

abstract = {The average static (dc) electric dipole polarizabilities of the NaK and KCs heteronuclear alkali dimers have been measured, and those of the homonuclear molecules remeasured using molecular beam deflection in an inhomogeneous electric field. A congruent magnetic field enabled removal of the monomer constituents of the beam. The resulting deflection curves reflect both the permanent electric dipole force (for the heteronuclear dimers only), and the induced (polarizability) dipole force. It is assumed that the molecular constituents of the beam possess modified Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity and rotational state distributions. A Mach number is introduced to describe the sonic beam properties. The data analysis consists of a two‐parameter least squares best fit of the experimental deflection curves to computed ones, the parameters being the polarizability and the Mach number. Values of the permanent heteronuclear dipole moments are taken from the literature. The obtained static electric dipole polarizabilities in units of ({\AA}3) are 34±3 for Li2 (948 K), 40±3 for Na2 (676 K), 77±6 for K2 (542 K), 79±6 for Rb2 (527 K), 104±8 for Cs2 (480 K), 51±3 for NaK (612 K), and 89±5 for KCs (488 K). Comparison with recent calculations as well as earlier measurements of the homonuclear species are given. Two empirical rules are proposed for determining polarizabilities and dipole moments of heteronuclear molecules.},

By use of only a single adjustable atomic parameter, which is related to the radius of the core and determines the cutoff at short range, our effective core polarization potential (CPP) accounts quantitatively for dynamical intershell correlation as well as exclusion effects on the correlation energy of the core. The applications refer to alkali and alkaline earth atoms (Li to K and Be to Ca) and a detailed analysis is performed for core polarization effects on ionization energies, electron affinities, oscillator strengths, polarizabilities, van der Waals coefficients, the valence electron density, and spin densities. Very accurate results are obtained for well‐known energetic properties and spin densities at the nucleus. With respect to the other applications we consider our results as the most reliable to date with an estimated uncertainty of 1%–2%.},

Additionally, our result places constraints on a variety of new physics scenarios beyond the SM.

The in-flight decay of the excited-state fluorescence is observed with a position-correlated single photon-counting detector. The Doppler-shifted 6p 2P3/2 resonance, when probed with longitudinally propagating laser radiation, provides a precise means for determination of the beam velocity, and converts the position scale to a time scale.

abstract = {Atomic polarization phenomena impinge upon a number of areas and processes in physics. The dielectric constant and refractive index of any gas are examples of macroscopic properties that are largely determined by the dipole polarizability. When it comes to microscopic phenomena, the existence of alkaline-earth anions and the recently discovered ability of positrons to bind to many atoms are predominantly due to the polarization interaction. An imperfect knowledge of atomic polarizabilities is presently looming as the largest source of uncertainty in the new generation of optical frequency standards. Accurate polarizabilities for the group I and II atoms and ions of the periodic table have recently become available by a variety of techniques. These include refined many-body perturbation theory and coupled-cluster calculations sometimes combined with precise experimental data for selected transitions, microwave spectroscopy of Rydberg atoms and ions, refractive index measurements in microwave cavities, ab initio calculations of atomic structures using explicitly correlated wave functions, interferometry with atom beams, and velocity changes of laser cooled atoms induced by an electric field. This review examines existing theoretical methods of determining atomic and ionic polarizabilities, and discusses their relevance to various applications with particular emphasis on cold-atom physics and the metrology of atomic frequency standards.},

abstract = {We discuss results of the most accurate to-date test of the low-energy electroweak sector of the standard model of elementary particles. Combining previous measurements with our high-precision calculations we extracted the weak charge of the 133Cs nucleus, Q_W = -73.16(29)_exp (20)_th [S.G. Porsev, K. Beloy, and A. Derevianko, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 102}, 181601 (2009)]. The result is in perfect agreement with Q_W^{SM} predicted by the standard model, Q_W^{SM} =-73.16(3), and confirms energy-dependence (or running) of the electroweak interaction and places constraints on a variety of new physics scenarios beyond the standard model. In particular, we increase the lower limit on the masses of extra Z-bosons predicted by models of grand unification and string theories. This paper provides additional details to the Letter. We discuss large-scale calculations in the framework of the coupled-cluster method, including full treatment of single, double, and valence triple excitations. To determine the accuracy of the calculations we computed energies, electric-dipole amplitudes, and hyperfine-structure constants. An extensive comparison with high-accuracy experimental data was carried out.},
